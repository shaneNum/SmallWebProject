                <p class="about-text">What if minecraft have much more cooler technology? But still feel to the core roots of its style? Well this is it, the most magical and by far the best minecraft mod for its innovation and creativity. this mod make minecraft farms much more interesting take, instead a block of multi pourpose factory, Create makes you create the factory to your liking, its so customizable to the point it feels like another game called "Factorio". This mod adds a lot, a fully customizable train, gears that make the factory move, and the core of power called rotation, that can be created using windmill, steam engine, waterwheel and so many more. And all of it can be design to your liking, making it easy to learn and hard to master for space, effectivity, and efficiency. if you want to know how good it is, click this title! </p>

                <p class="about-text">The ultimate challenge, sooo many addition thats spice the vanilla Terraria and crank it to the hundreds! So many boss, so many weapon, so many progression, new class, battle overhaul, and beatiful art and music, and the difficulty are insane. I recommend to finish terraria first all of it before tackling this behemoth of a mod, so many cool thing created that even the dev couldnt even come up, with the lore & story revamp, wonders it made to follow foot to your journeys to over coming everything. But do note, you'll be downloading a lot of addons that corelate to Calamity Mod, like Calamity Music Mod, Catalyst Mod, Or If You Wanna Even Harder Calamity, Infernum Mod. If that havent peak your interest click the title to see what you're sign up to.</p>

        <div class="about-why">
            <p class="about-title">Some Issue & Hope</p>
            <p class="about-text">Sadly modification are only special in some game, because modding can also mean hacking the game. To a competitive centered game like Valorant, Dota, and many more may lead a lot of issue and a banable offense. It is must to know that the developer or the company allowed to greenlit modding in general, such as that 2 game having a huge modding community. It is also great to mention how valve's game started as a mod from a small team, and thats why steam have workshop, a place for modding it self to flurish. Good luck on your modding adventure</p>
